This webapp for mobile devices provides a Capital One user the ability to have a faster checkout experience at retail stores. When the user opens the home page, and has already logged in, they have the option to add new items to purchase, look at their currrent cart, or view their transaction history. When they want to add a new item, they will go to the scan screen. This screen recognizes the user's location, and initially gives the closest retail store. If this is not the location they are at, they can click to change through to other local retail stores until they find the correct one. After this, they place a barcode under the camera, and the program then scans the barcode, finds the product, and adds to the cart. Once the user is ready to complete their purchase, they may click checkout. The checkout screen will then list all the items in the cart, also allowing the user to remove any unwanted items. Finally, they click submit purchase, and the total is automatically removed from their Capital One bank account.
